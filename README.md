# Rutgers-ECE-445-Machine-Learning-Project
Final Project at the end of Machine Learning class at the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at Rutgers University.

The Project consists of a Clustering Problem and a Classification Problem. The following algorithms are studied here;

#### Clustering
- Gaussian Mixture Models
- K Means Clustering 
- Spectral Clustering

#### Classification
- K Nearest Neighbors
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
- Naive Bayes
